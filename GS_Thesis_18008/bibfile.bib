@article{Kjurkchieva2020,
abstract = {We present the 40 cm telescope of the Shumen Astronomical Observatory and its equipment allowing remote-controlled observations.We found that the unit is appropriate for observations of different types of stars up to 15 mag with precision better than 0.02 mag for short exposures. The fainter stars would require exposures of order of several minutes. The additional autoguiding system of the 40 cm telescope allows prolonged patrols of variable stars as well as long exposures. We determine the transformation equations for transfer to standard Sloan g', r', i' photometric system. Finally, the paper presents the first multicolor light curve obtained by the fully remote-controlled 40 cm telescope during one night. The observed target was the W UMa star GSC 04263-00881 with a period of around 6 hrs.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {For an unattended telescopes in Antarctic, the remote operation, autonomous observation and control are essential. An EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) and RTS2(Remote Telescope System, 2nd Version) based autonomous observation and control system with remoted operation is introduced in this paper. EPICS is a set of Open Source software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific instruments while RTS2 is an open source environment for control of a fully autonomous observatory. Using the advantage of EPICS and RTS2 respectively, a combined integrated software framework for autonomous observation and control is established that use RTS2 to fulfill the function of astronomical observation and use EPICS to fulfill the device control of telescope. A command and status interface for EPICS and RTS2 is designed to make the EPICS IOC (Input/Output Controller) components integrate to RTS2 directly. For the specification and requirement of control system of telescope in Antarctic, core components named Executor and Auto-focus for autonomous observation is designed and implemented with remote operation user interface based on Browser-Server mode. The whole system including the telescope is tested in Lijiang Observatory in Yunnan Province for practical observation to complete the autonomous observation and control, including telescope control, camera control, dome control, weather information acquisition with the local and remote operation.},
